# Loan-Default-Prediction-Project

This project uses data from the Loan Default dataset on kaggle.com to predict whether a mortgage will default through different classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and KNN). <br>
The notebook also features a deep exploratory analysis of the datasets with many data visualizations and descriptive statistics, along with some feature engineering and null values handling. <br>
The original dataset can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset.
