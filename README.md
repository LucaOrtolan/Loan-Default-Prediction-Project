# Loan-Default-Prediction-Project

This project uses data from the Loan Default dataset on kaggle.com to develop four different classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and KNN) with the task of predicting whether a mortgage will default or not and compares their results. <br>
The notebook also features a deep exploratory analysis of the datasets with many data visualizations and descriptive statistics, along with some feature engineering and null values handling. 
The original data can be found in the csv file.
